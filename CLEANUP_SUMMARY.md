# Project Cleanup Summary

## What Was Cleaned Up

### âœ… Organized Documentation
Moved all markdown files into structured folders:
- **docs/weekly-reports/** - Progress reports (Week 1 & 2)
- **docs/project-plans/** - Setup guides and plans
- **docs/archive/** - Old/unused documentation

### âœ… Archived Old Code
Moved deprecated code to `archive/old-app/`:
- Old Flask `app/` directory
- Old `api/` directory (not the new one in `apps/`)
- `landing/` directory (old landing page)
- `writeups/` directory
- `cleanup/` directory
- Old deployment files (Dockerfile, Procfile, etc.)
- Old Python files (run.py, server.py, wsgi.py)
- Old requirements files
- Old vercel.json
- Database file (burnout_predictor.db)

### âœ… Removed Clutter
Deleted:
- `__pycache__/` directories
- `.vercel/` cache
- `.DS_Store` files

### âœ… Updated .gitignore
Added patterns to prevent future clutter:
- node_modules/
- dist/, build/
- archive/
- .env, .env.local
- *.pyc, __pycache__

### âœ… Created Clean README
New root README.md with:
- Quick start guide
- Clear project structure
- Feature overview
- Documentation links
- Concise and professional

## What's Active vs Archived

### âœ… Active Code (In Use)
- `apps/api/` - Current FastAPI backend
- `apps/web/` - Current React frontend
- `packages/database/` - PostgreSQL schema

### ðŸ“¦ Archived (Not in Use)
- `archive/old-app/` - Old Flask application
- All old deployment files
- Old documentation in `docs/archive/`

---

## File Counts

**Before Cleanup:**
- Root directory: ~40 files/folders
- Many old Python files, configs, databases
- Unorganized markdown files
- Multiple deployment configs

**After Cleanup:**
- Root directory: 8 items (clean!)
- All docs organized in `docs/`
- All old code in `archive/`
- Professional structure

---

## Benefits

1. **Clear Structure** - Easy to navigate
2. **Professional** - Ready for GitHub showcase
3. **Maintainable** - Know what's active vs archived
4. **Clean Git** - No clutter in version control
5. **Portfolio Ready** - Looks polished and organized

---

## Important Notes

- **Nothing was deleted permanently** - All old code is in `archive/`
- **New application is untouched** - `apps/` directory fully functional
- **Documentation preserved** - Just reorganized for clarity
- **Git history intact** - Only moved/organized files

---

## If You Need Old Code

Everything is preserved in `archive/old-app/`:
- Old Flask app
- Old API implementations
- Old deployment configs
- Old landing page

Just don't run it - use the new `apps/` structure instead!

**Cleanup completed**: Professional, organized, portfolio-ready! âœ¨
